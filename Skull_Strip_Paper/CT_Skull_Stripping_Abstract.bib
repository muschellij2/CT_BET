	abstract = {Background and Purpose. Controlling for intracranial volume is crucial in magnetic resonance studies of changes in brain volumes. However, full intracranial volume measurement requires prolonged scanning and analysis, and simple, validated methods for intracranial volume estimation are lacking. The authors developed and evaluated a method of estimating intracranial volume using a single mid-sagittal slice, the intracranial cross-sectional area. Methods. Forty men aged 65–70 had whole skull magnetic resonance scans at 1.9 T, with slice thickness of 1.5 mm (no interslice gap). Intracranial cross-sectional area was traced in the midline sagittal slice of the 3-view localizer. Intracranial volume was measured using every slice. Ten intracranial cross-sectional area measurements were tested for interrater reliability. Results. Intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume correlated highly (r= .88, P {\textless} .0001). A modified Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume. The intraclass correlation (an indicator of reliability) for intracranial cross-sectional area was r= .976 (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions. The rapid and simple technique of intracranial cross-sectional area measurement provides a valid and reliable estimate of intracranial volume.},

	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT)} images are widely used in the diagnosis of stroke. In this paper, we present an automated method to detect and classify an abnormality into acute infarct, chronic infarct and hemorrhage at the slice level of non-contrast {CT} images. The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

	abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and {fMRI} experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

The resulting system has been used for research in both basic biomedical and clinically applied settings. {3D} Slicer is built on a set of powerful and widely used software components ({Tcl/Tk}, {VTK}, {ITK)} to which is added an application layer that makes the system usable by non-programmer end-users. Using this approach, advanced applications including image guided surgery, robotics, brain mapping, and virtual colonoscopy have been implemented as {3D} Slicer modules. In this paper we discuss some of the goals of the {3D} Slicer project and how the architecture helps support those goals. We also point out some of the practical issues which arise from this approach.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE:} The quantitative nature of {CT} should make it amenable to semiautomated analysis using modern neuroimaging methods. The purpose of this study was to begin to develop automated methods of analysis of {CT} scans to identify putative hypodensity within the lentiform nucleus and insula in patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke.
{METHODS:} Thirty-five {CT} scans were retrospectively selected from our {CT} archive (scans of 20 normal control participants and 15 patients presenting with acute middle cerebral artery stroke symptoms). The {DICOM} data for each participant were interpolated to a single volume, scalp stripped, normalized to a standard atlas, and segmented into anatomic regions. Voxel densities in the lentiform nucleus and insula were compared with the contralateral side at P {\textless} .01 using the Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum statistic, corrected for spatial autocorrelation.
{RESULTS:} The quality of the registration for the anatomic regions was excellent. The control group had two false-positive results. The patient group had two false-negative results in the lentiform nucleus, two false-negative results in the insular cortex, and one false-positive finding for the insular cortex. The remainder of the infarcts were correctly identified. The original clinical reading, performed at the time of presentation, produced five false-negative interpretations for the patient group, all of which were correctly identified by the automated algorithm.
{CONCLUSION:} We present an automated method for identifying potential areas of acute ischemia on {CT} scans. This approach can be extended to other brain regions and vascular territories and may aid in the interpretation of {CT} scans in cases of hyperacute stroke.},

	abstract = {Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} is greatly aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify, and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features. First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human {MR} images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

We recently proposed that adults depend on distinct frontoparietal and cinguloopercular networks for adaptive online task control versus more stable set control, respectively. During development, both experience-dependent evoked activity and spontaneous waves of synchronized cortical activity are thought to support the formation and maintenance of neural networks. Such mechanisms may encourage tighter “integration” of some regions into networks over time while “segregating” other sets of regions into separate networks. Here we use resting state functional connectivity {MRI}, which measures correlations in spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between brain regions to compare previously identified control networks between children and adults. We find that development of the proposed adult control networks involves both segregation (i.e., decreased short-range connections) and integration (i.e., increased long-range connections) of the brain regions that comprise them. Delay/disruption in the developmental processes of segregation and integration may play a role in disorders of control, such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization, registration, and segmentation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI)} often use a target or template volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information, and define a common coordinate system for analysis. In the neuroimaging literature, the {MNI305} Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations, variation from the adult brain makes the {MNI305} suboptimal for processing brain images of children. Morphological changes occurring during development render the use of age-appropriate templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased, age-appropriate {MRI} atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5–18.5 years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal) sample of the {U.S.} population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry study using 66 young (4.5–6.9 years) participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates. The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of pediatric {MRI} data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.},

	abstract = {Objective: The maturation of the neocortex during childhood and adolescence involves dramatic increases in white-matter volume. {EEG} recordings from children and adults were examined to determine whether there are associated changes in spatial properties of dynamic processes in the neocortex. Methods: Spontaneous eyes-closed and eyes-open {EEG} were recorded at 128 electrodes in 20 children aged 6–11 years and 23 adults aged 18–23 years. The surface Laplacian algorithm was applied to improve the spatial resolution of each electrode. Power and coherence were used to characterize the spatial structure of the alpha rhythm. A stochastic field model was used to eliminate coherences that are inflated due to volume conduction. Results: In adults, the alpha rhythm is characterized by very high coherence between distant electrodes. The children demonstrated reduced anterior power and coherence between anterior and posterior electrodes at the peak alpha frequency in comparison to the adults. The Laplacian alpha rhythm demonstrated much higher power in the children at both anterior and posterior electrodes, but was weakly correlated between electrodes. Conclusions: The maturation of neocortex in late childhood involves increased global correlation by long-range corticocortical connections. The local correlation that contributes power to each electrode, independent of other electrodes, is reduced as the global correlation increases.},

This paper presents a comparison of the commonly used brain masking techniques in functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, a masking algorithm based on connected components analysis along with Gaussian smoothing is introduced. The contiguous binary brain mask obtained by the new algorithm is shown to be more effective than the ones obtained by the commonly deployed masking algorithms. The introduced algorithm can also be applied to different image modalities that need to be registered to the space of anatomy or to the native space of echo planar images.},

However, full intracranial volume measurement requires prolonged scanning and analysis, and simple, validated methods for intracranial volume estimation are lacking. The authors developed and evaluated a method of estimating intracranial volume using a single mid-sagittal slice, the intracranial cross-sectional area. Methods. Forty men aged 65–70 had whole skull magnetic resonance scans at 1.9 T, with slice thickness of 1.5 mm (no interslice gap). Intracranial cross-sectional area was traced in the midline sagittal slice of the 3-view localizer. Intracranial volume was measured using every slice. Ten intracranial cross-sectional area measurements were tested for interrater reliability. Results. Intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume correlated highly (r= .88, P {\textless} .0001). A modified Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume. The intraclass correlation (an indicator of reliability) for intracranial cross-sectional area was r= .976 (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions. The rapid and simple technique of intracranial cross-sectional area measurement provides a valid and reliable estimate of intracranial volume.},

	abstract = {Over the last years, increasing evidence has fuelled the hypothesis that Autism Spectrum Disorder ({ASD)} is a condition of altered brain functional connectivity. The great majority of these empirical studies relies on functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} which has a relatively poor temporal resolution. Only a handful of studies has examined networks emerging from dynamic coherence at the millisecond resolution and there are no investigations of coherence at the lowest frequencies in the power spectrum—which has recently been shown to reflect long-range cortico-cortical connections. Here we used electroencephalography ({EEG)} to assess dynamic brain connectivity in {ASD} focusing in the low-frequency (delta) range. We found that connectivity patterns were distinct in {ASD} and control populations and reflected a double dissociation: {ASD} subjects lacked long-range connections, with a most prominent deficit in fronto-occipital connections. Conversely, individuals with {ASD} showed increased short-range connections in lateral–frontal electrodes. This effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as {ASD} severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in {ASD} subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length than controls – indicating that the topology of the network departs from small-world behaviour – and greater modularity. Together these results show that delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated with {ASD} pathology.},

	abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI.}
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP)} scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr)} on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr.} The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

	abstract = {Over the last years, increasing evidence has fuelled the hypothesis that Autism Spectrum Disorder ({ASD)} is a condition of altered brain functional connectivity. The great majority of these empirical studies relies on functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} which has a relatively poor temporal resolution. Only a handful of studies has examined networks emerging from dynamic coherence at the millisecond resolution and there are no investigations of coherence at the lowest frequencies in the power spectrum—which has recently been shown to reflect long-range cortico-cortical connections. Here we used electroencephalography ({EEG)} to assess dynamic brain connectivity in {ASD} focusing in the low-frequency (delta) range. We found that connectivity patterns were distinct in {ASD} and control populations and reflected a double dissociation: {ASD} subjects lacked long-range connections, with a most prominent deficit in fronto-occipital connections. Conversely, individuals with {ASD} showed increased short-range connections in lateral–frontal electrodes. This effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as {ASD} severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in {ASD} subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length than controls – indicating that the topology of the network departs from small-world behaviour – and greater modularity. Together these results show that delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated with {ASD} pathology.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— Our purpose was to determine (1) the correlation between quantitative {CT} and {MR} measurements of infarct core, penumbra, and mismatch; and (2) whether the difference between these measurements would alter patient selection for stroke clinical trials.
Methods— We studied 45 patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke imaged a mean of 3.8 hours after onset (range, 0.48 to 8.35 hours) who underwent {CT} perfusion and {MR} diffusion ({DWI)/perfusion} imaging within 3 hours of each other. The {DWI} and {MR-mean} transit time ({MTT)} abnormalities were visually segmented using a semiautomated commercial analysis program. The {CT-cerebral} blood volume) and {CT-MTT} lesions were automatically segmented using a relative cerebral blood volume threshold of 0.56 and a relative {MTT} threshold of 1.50 on commercially available software. Percent mismatch was defined as [({MTT−DWI)/DWI} volume]×100. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated.
Results— There were significant correlations for {DWI} versus {CT-cerebral} blood volume lesion volumes (r2=0.88, P{\textless}0.001), for {MR-MTT} versus {CT-MTT} lesion volumes(r2=0.86, P{\textless}0.001), and for {MR-MTT/DWI} versus {CT-MTT/CT-cerebral} blood volume mismatch lesion volumes(r2=0.81, P{\textless}0.001). {MR} perfusion and {CT} perfusion agreed for determining: (1) infarct core {\textless} versus ≥100 {mL} in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); (2) {MTT} lesion size {\textless} versus {\textgreater}2 cm diameter in 42 of 45 (93.3\%); (3) mismatch {\textless} versus {\textgreater}20\% in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); and (4) inclusion versus exclusion from trial enrollment in 38 of 45 (84.4\%) patients. Six of 7 disagreements were due to inadequate {CT} coverage.
Conclusion— Advanced {MR} and {CT} perfusion imaging measurements of core/penumbra mismatch for patient selection in stroke trials are highly correlated when {CT} perfusion coverage is sufficient to include most of the ischemic region. Although {MR} is currently the preferred imaging method for determining core and penumbra, {CT} perfusion is comparable and potentially more available.},

	abstract = {Objective: The maturation of the neocortex during childhood and adolescence involves dramatic increases in white-matter volume. {EEG} recordings from children and adults were examined to determine whether there are associated changes in spatial properties of dynamic processes in the neocortex. Methods: Spontaneous eyes-closed and eyes-open {EEG} were recorded at 128 electrodes in 20 children aged 6–11 years and 23 adults aged 18–23 years. The surface Laplacian algorithm was applied to improve the spatial resolution of each electrode. Power and coherence were used to characterize the spatial structure of the alpha rhythm. A stochastic field model was used to eliminate coherences that are inflated due to volume conduction. Results: In adults, the alpha rhythm is characterized by very high coherence between distant electrodes. The children demonstrated reduced anterior power and coherence between anterior and posterior electrodes at the peak alpha frequency in comparison to the adults. The Laplacian alpha rhythm demonstrated much higher power in the children at both anterior and posterior electrodes, but was weakly correlated between electrodes. Conclusions: The maturation of neocortex in late childhood involves increased global correlation by long-range corticocortical connections. The local correlation that contributes power to each electrode, independent of other electrodes, is reduced as the global correlation increases.},

	abstract = {While neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by steady degeneration over relatively long timelines, it is widely believed that the early stages are the most promising for therapeutic intervention, before irreversible neuronal loss occurs. Developing a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease progression. However, since the early stages are for the most part asymptomatic, obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is difficult. Longitudinal databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of validated biomarkers are becoming available, allowing the use of computational methods. We propose a widely applicable statistical methodology for creating a disease progression score ({DPS)}, using multiple biomarkers, for subjects with a neurodegenerative disease. The proposed methodology was evaluated for Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} using the publicly available {AD} Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI)} database, yielding an Alzheimer's {DPS} or {ADPS} score for each subject and each time-point in the database. In addition, a common description of biomarker changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the biomarkers. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest biomarker to become abnormal. The group of biomarkers comprising the volume of the hippocampus and the protein concentration amyloid beta and Tau were next in the timeline, and these were followed by three cognitive biomarkers. The proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common behaviors of biomarkers in the disease itself.},

The first step is automatic determination of head symmetry axis, with the possibility of manual improvement of the result if necessary. Symmetry axis calculation is based on moments. In the second step, the seeded region-growing ({SRG)} algorithm is used to segment the input image into a number of regions having uniform brightness. Features of these regions, such as brightness, area, neighborhood and relative position to the symmetry axis are used to create facts for a rule-based expert system. Based on created facts and pre-defined rules as input, the rule-based expert system is used in the third step to label regions as background, skull, gray/white matter, {CSF} and stroke.

The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

Discriminant analysis of 21 parameters from the initial examination and {CT} scan, selected five factors which best separate the two groups, since 89\% of the patients were well classified. These five parameters (age, consciousness impairment, temperature, volume of the hematoma and ventricular hemorrhage) combined, give a prognostic score which gives for each patient his probability of survival or death. The validity of the proposed model was controlled on a test-sample of 66 patients from another department.

	abstract = {Motivated by the vast amount of information that is rapidly accumulating about the human brain in digital form, we embarked upon a program in 1992 to develop a four–dimensional probabilistic atlas and reference system for the human brain. Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping ({ICBM}) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono– and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. {DNA} has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post–mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto– and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro– and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype–phenotype–behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for automatic segmentation and labeling of computerised tomography ({CT}) head images of stroke lesions. The method is composed of three steps. The first step is automatic determination of head symmetry axis, with the possibility of manual improvement of the result if necessary. Symmetry axis calculation is based on moments. In the second step, the seeded region-growing ({SRG}) algorithm is used to segment the input image into a number of regions having uniform brightness. Features of these regions, such as brightness, area, neighborhood and relative position to the symmetry axis are used to create facts for a rule-based expert system. Based on created facts and pre-defined rules as input, the rule-based expert system is used in the third step to label regions as background, skull, gray/white matter, {CSF} and stroke. Experimental results have been conducted and have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method},

In this communication we present a recursive procedure for using {BET} that is extremely robust for extracting brain images without any manual intervention.

Automatic registration is achieved by maximization of a similarity metric, which is the correlation function of two images. The proposed method has been implemented by choosing a realistic, practical transformation and optimization techniques. Correlation-based similarity metric should be maximal when two images are perfectly aligned. Since similarity metric is a non-convex function and contains many local optima, choice of search strategy for optimization is important in registration problem. Many optimization schemes are existing, most of which are local and require a starting point. In present study we have implemented genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization technique to overcome this problem. A comparative study shows the superiority and robustness of swarm methodology over genetic approach.},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization reshapes an individual's brain to match the shape and size of a template image. This is a crucial step required for group-level statistical analyses. The most popular standard templates are derived from {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM} toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).},

Safety stopping rules based on neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were prespecified and approved by an {NIH}-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which provided oversight on subject safety. Each subject was followed-up for 3 months to preliminarily assess mortality and the clinical outcomes. A total of 18, 20, and 22 patients were enrolled in the respective three tiers of systolic blood pressure treatment goals. Overall, 9 of 60 patients had treatment failures (all in the last tier). A total of seven subjects with neurologic deterioration were observed: one (6\%), two (10\%), and four (18\%) in tier one, two, and three, respectively. Serious adverse events were observed in one subject (5\%) in tier two and in three subjects (14\%) in tier three. However, the safety stopping rule was not activated in any of the tiers. Three (17\%), two (10\%), and five (23\%) subjects in tiers one, two, and three, respectively, died within 3 months., Conclusions: The observed proportions of neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events were below the prespecified safety thresholds, and the 3-month mortality rate was lower than expected in all systolic blood pressure tiers. The results form the basis of a larger randomized trial addressing the efficacy of systolic blood pressure reduction in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage., (C) 2010 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins},

As one of the applications of the atlas, automated brain segmentation was performed and the accuracy was measured using Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping ({LDDMM}). High-quality diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) data from a single-participant were B0-distortion-corrected and transformed to the {ICBM}-152 atlas or to Talairach coordinates. The deep white matter structures, which have been previously well documented and clearly identified by {DTI}, were manually segmented. The superficial white matter areas beneath the cortex were defined, based on a population-averaged white matter probability map. The white matter was parcellated into 176 regions based on the anatomical labeling in the {ICBM}-{DTI}-81 atlas. The automated parcellation was achieved by warping this parcellation map to normal controls and to Alzheimer's disease patients with severe anatomical atrophy. The parcellation accuracy was measured by a kappa analysis between the automated and manual parcellation at 11 anatomical regions. The kappa values were 0.70 for both normal controls and patients while the inter-rater reproducibility was 0.81 (controls) and 0.82 (patients), suggesting “almost perfect” agreement. A power analysis suggested that the proposed method is suitable for detecting {FA} and size abnormalities of the white matter in clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) is greatly aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify, and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features. First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human {MR} images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

We compare four proposed measures of voxel similarity using the same optimization scheme when presented with 10 pairs of images with a range of initial misregistrations. The registration estimates are compared with those provided by manual point-based registration and evaluated by visual inspection to give an assessment of the robustness and accuracy of the different measures. One full-volume {CT} image set is used to investigate the performance of each measure when used to align truncated images from different regions in the head. The soft tissue correlation and mutual information measures were found to provide the most robust measures of misregistration, providing results comparable to or better than those from manual point-based registration for all but the most truncated image volumes.},

	abstract = {Explicit segmentation is required for many forms of quantitative neuroanatomic analysis. However, manual methods are time-consuming and subject to errors in both accuracy and reproducibility (precision). A 3-D model-based segmentation method is presented in this paper for the completely automatic identification and delineation of gross anatomical structures of the human brain based on their appearance in magnetic resonance images ({MRI}). The approach depends on a general, iterative, hierarchical non-linear registration procedure and a 3-D digital model of human brain anatomy that contains both volumetric intensity-based data and a geometric atlas. Here, the traditional segmentation strategy is inverted: instead of matching geometric contours from and idealized atlas directly to the {MRI} data, segmentation is achieved by identifying the non-linear spatial transformation that best maps corresponding intensity-based features between a model image and a new {MRI} brain volume. When completed, atlas contours defined on the model image are mapped through the same transformation to segment and label individual structures in the new data set. Using manually segmented sturcture boundaries for comparison, measures of volumetric difference and volumetric overlap were less than 2\% and better than 97\% for realistic brain phantom data, and less than 10\% and better than 85\%, respectively, for human {MRI} data. This compares favorably to intra-observer variability estimates of 4.9\% and 87\%, respectively. The procedure performs well, is objective and its implementation robust. The procedure requires no manual intervention, and is thus applicable to studies of large numbers of subjects. The general method for non-linear image matching is also useful for non-linear mapping of brain data sets into stereotaxic space if the target volume is already in stereotaxic space. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In this paper, we investigate the performance of various optimization methods and multiresolution strategies for maximization of mutual information, aiming at increasing registration speed when matching large high-resolution images. We show that mutual information is a continuous function of the affine registration parameters when appropriate interpolation is used and we derive analytic expressions of its derivatives that allow numerically exact evaluation of its gradient. Various multiresolution gradient- and non-gradient-based optimization strategies, such as Powell, simplex, steepest-descent, conjugate-gradient, quasi-Newton and Levenberg—Marquardt methods, are evaluated for registration of computed tomography ({CT}) and magnetic resonance images of the brain. Speed-ups of a factor of 3 on average compared to Powell's method at full resolution are achieved with similar precision and without a loss of robustness with the simplex, conjugate-gradient and Levenberg—Marquardt method using a two-level multiresolution scheme. Large data sets such as 2562 × 128 {MR} and 5122 × 48 {CT} images can be registered with subvoxel precision in {\textless} 5 min {CPU} time on current workstations.},

This approach produces a consistent set of transformations that have less pairwise registration error, i.e., better correspondence, than traditional methods that estimate the forward and reverse transformations independently. The transformations are estimated iteratively and are restricted to preserve topology by constraining them to obey the laws of continuum mechanics. The transformations are parameterized by a Fourier series to diagonalize the covariance structure imposed by the continuum mechanics constraints and to provide a computationally efficient numerical implementation. Results using a linear elastic material constraint are presented using both magnetic resonance and X-ray computed tomography image data. The results show that the joint estimation of a consistent set of forward and reverse transformations constrained by linear-elasticity give better registration results than using either constraint alone or none at all.},

The consistent landmark and intensity registration algorithm produces good correspondences between images near landmark locations by matching corresponding landmarks and away from landmark locations by matching the image intensities. In contrast to similar unidirectional algorithms, these new consistent algorithms jointly estimate the forward and reverse transformation between two images while minimizing the inverse consistency error-the error between the forward (reverse) transformation and the inverse of the the reverse (forward) transformation. This reduces the ambiguous correspondence between the forward and reverse transformations associated with large inverse consistency errors. In both algorithms a thin-plate spline ({TPS}) model is used to regularize the estimated transformations. Two-dimensional (2-D) examples are presented that show the inverse consistency error produced by the traditional unidirectional landmark {TPS} algorithm can be relatively large and that this error is minimized using the consistent landmark algorithm. Results using 2-D magnetic resonance imaging data are presented that demonstrate that using landmark and intensity information together produce better correspondence between medical images than using either landmarks or intensity information alone.},

{METHODS} Medical records of 146 patients admitted to a major tertiary hospital in Karachi, Pakistan between 1990 and 1991 with a diagnosis of spontaneous {ICH} were reviewed. The level and intensity of care provided to these patients was similar to that available at modern neurosurgical centers. The salient prognostic indicators that were studied included hypertension, pulse pressure, {GCS} score, neurologic deficits, and {CT}-scan predictors including site, size, and intraventricular spread of hemorrhage. These data were used to determine independent predictors of 30-day mortality by univariate and multivariate analysis. Additionally, 30-day survival probabilities for these outcome predictors were also computed.
{RESULTS} The 30-day mortality after spontaneous {ICH} was 39.7\%. Two-thirds of the patients had a history of hypertension. The important clinical predictors at the multivariate level included {GCS} score ≤8 and progressive increase in pulse pressure. The {CT} scan predictors included intraventricular spread of hemorrhage, ventricular enlargement, and size of the bleed. Location of the lesion did not appear to significantly influence mortality. Survival analysis showed a large clustering of deaths within the first 72 hours of hospitalization.
{CONCLUSIONS} The 30-day mortality rate and prognostic predictors for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage were found to be similar to those reported in the Western hemisphere. However, the correlation of incremental increase in pulse pressure with deteriorating prognosis was a new and significant finding.},

This study specifically addressed patients seen in the emergency room within a few hours of the ictus, many of whom were still awake, to identify and subsequently exclude from surgical procedure those expected to recover completely and those expected to die regardless of treatment. We retrospectively studied 75 patients evaluated at a mean time of 3 hours and 37 minutes after hemispheric {ICH} to determine factors that would predict both good and poor outcomes at the time of discharge. Eighty percent of our patients presented within 6 hours of symptom onset. These patients were younger and had more severe lesions than did those presenting later, yet most were still awake (mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale [{GCS}] score = 11.0). Using multivariate regression, we created two models. The first model predicts independent outcome, i.e, Rankin 0 to 2, of all patients with a {GCS} score greater than 9 on admission who do not undergo surgery. The significant factors in this model were hemorrhage diameter, intraventricular extension, and age. The second model predicts poor outcome, i.e, Rankin 5 and death, of all patients. {GCS} score, hemorrhage volume, age, and gender were the important factors in this model. We conclude that {ICH} patients presenting early to the emergency room have more severe lesions radiologically, although their initial clinical status may not be different from those seen late. Our models should identify and thus exclude those with very good and very poor prognoses from future randomized surgical trials.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.
A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat.
1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0·89 [95\% {CI} 0·66–1·19], p=0·414); absolute benefit 2·3\% (–3·2 to 7·7), relative benefit 10\% (–13 to 33).
Patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment.},

	abstract = {The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of 10–100 {mL} and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these patients.
In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78 centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOSE}) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number {ISRCTN}22153967.
307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis, respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3·7\% [95\% {CI} −4·3 to 11·6], odds ratio 0·86 [0·62 to 1·20]; p=0·367).
The {STICH} {II} results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage.

	abstract = {Treatment of primary {SICH} is still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of craniotomy and early hematoma evacuation vs nonoperative management in patients with {SICH}.
A prospective randomized study of craniotomy and early hematoma removal vs best medical management was performed in 108 patients with primary {SICH}. Surgical or medical treatment was initiated within 8 hours post ictus. Principal eligibility criterium was the presence of neurologic impairment associated with a spontaneous subcortical or putaminal hemorrhage bigger than 30 {mL}. Outcomes were assessed at 1 year post ictus.
Analysis of outcome revealed a significantly higher percentage of {GOS} scores higher than 3 for the surgical patients, compared with those of the conservative group (33\% and 9\%, respectively; P {\textless} .05). By contrast, the mortality rates between operated and conservatively managed patients did not differ significantly. The main prognostic variables were the initial neurologic status, hematoma volume, and location. Stratifications of these parameters and analysis showed that the positive effect of surgery on the quality of survival was statistically not valid for patients with {GCS} scores lower than 8 or {ICH} volumes 80 {mL} or higher at the time of enrollment.
The study demonstrates that surgical patients with subcortical or putaminal hematomas showed better functional results than their conservatively treated counterparts. However, early {ICH} evacuation failed to improve the survival rates, as compared with best medical management.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ({HMG}-{CoA}) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been associated with improved outcome after ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage but an increased risk of incident intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). We investigated (1) whether statin use before {ICH} was associated with functional independence at 90 days, and (2) whether survivors exposed to statins after {ICH} had an increased risk of recurrence.
Methods— We analyzed 629 consecutive {ICH} patients with 90-day outcome data enrolled in a prospective cohort study between 1998 to 2005. Statin use was determined by patient interview at the time of {ICH} and supplemented by medical record review. Independent status was defined as Glasgow Outcome Scale 4 or 5. {ICH} survivors were followed by telephone interview every 6 months.
Results— Statins were used by 149/629 (24\%) before {ICH}. There was no effect of pre-{ICH} statin use on the rates of functional independence (28\% versus 29\%, P=0.84) or mortality (46\% versus 45\%, P=0.93). Medical comorbidities and warfarin use were more common in statin users. Hematoma volumes were similar (median 28 cm3 in pre-{ICH} statin users compared to 22 cm3 in nonusers, P=0.18). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for independent status in pre-{ICH} statin users was 1.16 (95\% {CI} 0.65 to 2.10, P=0.62). {ICH} survivors treated with statins after discharge did not have a higher risk of recurrence (adjusted {HR} 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.34 to 1.99, P=0.66).
Conclusions— Pre-{ICH} statin use is not associated with improved {ICH} functional outcome or mortality. Post-{ICH} statin use is not associated with an increased risk of {ICH} recurrence.},

	abstract = {Purpose—The aim of this guideline is to present current and comprehensive recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.
Methods—A formal literature search of {MEDLINE} was performed. Data were synthesized with the use of evidence tables. Writing committee members met by teleconference to discuss data-derived recommendations. The American Heart Association Stroke Council’s Levels of Evidence grading algorithm was used to grade each recommendation. Prerelease review of the draft guideline was performed by 6 expert peer reviewers and by the members of the Stroke Council Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and Stroke Council Leadership Committee. It is intended that this guideline be fully updated in 3 years’ time.
Results—Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage. The focus was subdivided into diagnosis, hemostasis, blood pressure management, inpatient and nursing management, preventing medical comorbidities, surgical treatment, outcome prediction, rehabilitation, prevention of recurrence, and future considerations.
Conclusions—Intracerebral hemorrhage is a serious medical condition for which outcome can be impacted by early, aggressive care. The guidelines offer a framework for goal-directed treatment of the patient with intracerebral hemorrhage.},

The white matter has been structurally defined in the past only at its core regions (deep white matter). However, the most peripheral white matter areas, which are interleaved between the cortex and the deep white matter, have lacked clear anatomical definitions and parcellations. We used axonal fiber alignment information from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to delineate the peripheral white matter, and investigated its relationship with the cortex and the deep white matter. Using {DTI} data from 81 healthy subjects, we identified nine common, blade-like anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into 21 subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short association fiber tracts connecting adjacent gyri (U-fibers) were also identified reproducibly among the healthy population. We anticipate that this atlas will be useful resource for atlas-based white matter anatomical studies.},

	doi = {10.1161/01.STR.31.9.2157},
	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Previous studies have shown that the volume of intracerebral hemorrhage and Glasgow Coma Score ({GCS}) on admission are powerful predictors of 30-day mortality. However, the significance of hydrocephalus associated with deep cerebral hemorrhage has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality in patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage.
Methods—We studied 100 consecutive patients with deep cerebral hemorrhage between 1994 and 1998. Deep cerebral hemorrhage was divided into 2 groups: putaminal hemorrhage (lateral group) and thalamic and caudate hemorrhage (medial group). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality.
Results—Hydrocephalus was present in 40 of the 100 patients. The 30-day mortality was 29\%, and hydrocephalus was present in 76\% of those who died. Multivariate analyses showed 2 independent prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality for putaminal hemorrhage: {GCS} ≤8 (P=0.002, odds ratio [{OR}] 37.7, {CI} 3.6 to 396.9) and hydrocephalus (P=0.005, {OR} 27.4, {CI} 2.7 to 282.6). However, only {GCS} ≤8 (P=0.0002, {OR} 16.5, {CI} 3.7 to 73.4) was predictive of 30-day mortality for thalamic and caudate hemorrhage. This model ({GCS} ≤8 and hydrocephalus) has a sensitivity of 57\% and a specificity of 91\% for predicting 30-day mortality for putaminal hemorrhage. When both attributes were present in putaminal hemorrhage ({GCS} ≤8 and hydrocephalus), 1 (11\%) of 9 patients survived, and when both attributes were missing 28 (100\%) of 28 patients survived.
Conclusions—Obstructive hydrocephalus on admission in a comatose patient with a putaminal hemorrhage predicts 30-day mortality.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Although several factors have been identified that predict outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}), no previous study has investigated the impact of hydrocephalus. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of hydrocephalus after {ICH} would predict mortality and functional outcome.
Methods—Patients with spontaneous supratentorial {ICH} were identified in our prospectively collected database to determine the following: age, sex, race, past medical history; Glasgow Coma Scale ({GCS}) score and blood pressure on admission; use of mechanical ventilation, mannitol, and ventriculostomy; and medical complications. {CT} scans performed within 24 hours of hemorrhage were retrospectively analyzed to determine lesion size and location, pineal shift, cisternal effacement, intraventricular hemorrhage ({IVH}), and hydrocephalus. Outcome was determined with use of hospital disposition (dead, nursing home, rehabilitation, home) and functional outcome (Functional Independence Measure [{FIM}]) at 3 months. Patients with and without hydrocephalus were compared and univariate and multivariate analyses performed to determine whether hydrocephalus was an independent predictor of mortality. Data are presented as mean±{SD}.
Results—Of the 81 patients studied, 40 had hydrocephalus. Those with hydrocephalus were younger (57±15 versus 67±15 years), had lower {GCS} scores (8.2±4.2 versus 11±2.9), were more likely to have ganglionic or thalamic hemorrhages, and were intubated more frequently (70\% versus 27\%). Hospital mortality was higher in patients with hydrocephalus (51\% versus 2\%), and fewer patients went home (21\% versus 35\%). Those who died had higher hydrocephalus scores (9.67±7.1 versus 5.75±4.5). Outcome was no different if a ventriculostomy was placed. The final logistic regression model included hydrocephalus score, gender, {GCS}, and pineal shift, and it correctly predicted 85\% of patients as dead or alive. Multivariate analyses indicated that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of mortality.
Conclusions—We conclude that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of mortality after {ICH}.},

One hundred patients were separately interviewed by two physicians in different combinations. The degree of handicap was recorded by each observer on the modified Rankin scale, which has six grades (0-5). The agreement rates were corrected for chance (kappa statistics). Both physicians agreed on the degree of handicap in 65 patients; they differed by one grade in 32 patients and by two grades in 3 patients. Kappa for all pairwise observations was 0.56; the value for weighted kappa (with quadratic disagreement weights) was 0.91. Our results confirm the value of the modified Rankin scale in the assessment of handicap in stroke patients; nevertheless, further improvements are possible.},

Although the number of hospital admissions for intracerebral haemorrhage has increased worldwide in the past 10 years, mortality has not fallen. Results of clinical trials and observational studies suggest that coordinated primary and specialty care is associated with lower mortality than is typical community practice. Development of treatment goals for critical care, and new sequences of care and specialty practice can improve outcome after intracerebral haemorrhage. Specific treatment approaches include early diagnosis and haemostasis, aggressive management of blood pressure, open surgical and minimally invasive surgical techniques to remove clot, techniques to remove intraventricular blood, and management of intracranial pressure. These approaches improve clinical management of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and promise to reduce mortality and increase functional survival.},

However, full intracranial volume measurement requires prolonged scanning and analysis, and simple, validated methods for intracranial volume estimation are lacking. The authors developed and evaluated a method of estimating intracranial volume using a single mid-sagittal slice, the intracranial cross-sectional area. Methods. Forty men aged 65–70 had whole skull magnetic resonance scans at 1.9 T, with slice thickness of 1.5 mm (no interslice gap). Intracranial cross-sectional area was traced in the midline sagittal slice of the 3-view localizer. Intracranial volume was measured using every slice. Ten intracranial cross-sectional area measurements were tested for interrater reliability. Results. Intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume correlated highly (r= .88, P {\textless} .0001). A modified Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume. The intraclass correlation (an indicator of reliability) for intracranial cross-sectional area was r= .976 (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions. The rapid and simple technique of intracranial cross-sectional area measurement provides a valid and reliable estimate of intracranial volume.},

Test-retest reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r = 0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower extremity motor function were more valid.

Methods—We reviewed 627 patients with {ICH} admitted within 24 hours of onset. The first {CT} was performed at admission and the second within 24 hours of admission, and a blood sample was taken for laboratory examinations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the relationships between hematoma enlargement and time from onset, consciousness level, {CT} findings, amount of alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure at and after admission, clinical outcome, and hematologic parameters.
Results—Eighty-eight patients (14.0\%) showed enlarged hematomas after admission. Multivariate analyses revealed that the following five factors were independently associated with hematoma enlargement: the time from onset (odds ratio [{OR}], 0.26 for a 1-{SD} change; 4.9 hours; P{\textless}0.001); the amount of alcohol consumption ({OR}, 1.50 for 1 {SD}; 46.3 g/d; P=0.002); the sharp of hematoma ({OR}, 1.40 for 1 {SD}; 0.45 round; P=0.006); the presence of consciousness disturbance ({OR}, 1.38 for 1 {SD}; 0.50 coma; P=0.026); and the level of fibrinogen ({OR}, 0.74 for 1 {SD}; 87.1 mg/{dL}; P=0.042). Hematoma enlargement was an independent factor increasing the mortality rate in the {ICH} patients ({OR}, 1.57; P{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions—A particularly high likelihood of hematoma enlargement was observed in patients who (in order of importance) were admitted shortly after onset, who were heavy drinkers; who had an irregularly shaped hematoma, whose consciousness was disturbed, and who had a low level of fibrinogen.},

	abstract = {Mutual information ({MI})-based image registration has been found to be quite effective in many medical imaging applications. To determine the {MI} between two images, the joint histogram of the two images is required. In the literature, linear interpolation and partial volume interpolation ({PVI}) are often used while estimating the joint histogram for registration purposes. It has been shown that joint histogram estimation through these two interpolation methods may introduce artifacts in the {MI} registration function that hamper the optimization process and influence the registration accuracy. In this paper, we present a new joint histogram estimation scheme called generalized partial volume estimation ({GPVE}). It turns out that the {PVI} method is a special case of the {GPVE} procedure. We have implemented our algorithm on the clinically obtained brain computed tomography and magnetic resonance image data furnished by Vanderbilt University. Our experimental results show that, by properly choosing the kernel functions, the {GPVE} algorithm significantly reduces the interpolation-induced artifacts and, in cases that the artifacts clearly affect registration accuracy, the registration accuracy is improved.},

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of clinical characteristics and initial {CT} scan for outcome in black Americans with {SICH}.
Methods Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the charts of 182 consecutive black Americans admitted for {SICH} diagnosed by clinical criteria and initial {CT} scan. Hemorrhage volumes were calculated from admission {CT} scans by a computerized method. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of early deterioration (defined as a decrease from an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score {\textgreater}12 by ≥4 points within 24 hours from presentation) and mortality.
Results Both hemorrhage volume and ventricular extension were significant, independent predictors of early deterioration (odds ratio [{OR}], 6.78; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.89 to 24.35 and {OR}, 4.67; 95\% {CI}, 1.30 to 16.72, respectively) and mortality ({OR}, 6.66; 95\% {CI}, 2.85 to 15.58 and {OR}, 4.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.82 to 9.82, respectively). A Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤12 also predicted mortality ({OR}, 3.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.46 to 7.14). Initial mean arterial pressure was not an independent predictor of early deterioration or mortality.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— Our purpose was to determine (1) the correlation between quantitative {CT} and {MR} measurements of infarct core, penumbra, and mismatch; and (2) whether the difference between these measurements would alter patient selection for stroke clinical trials.
Methods— We studied 45 patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke imaged a mean of 3.8 hours after onset (range, 0.48 to 8.35 hours) who underwent {CT} perfusion and {MR} diffusion ({DWI})/perfusion imaging within 3 hours of each other. The {DWI} and {MR}-mean transit time ({MTT}) abnormalities were visually segmented using a semiautomated commercial analysis program. The {CT}-cerebral blood volume) and {CT}-{MTT} lesions were automatically segmented using a relative cerebral blood volume threshold of 0.56 and a relative {MTT} threshold of 1.50 on commercially available software. Percent mismatch was defined as [({MTT}−{DWI})/{DWI} volume]×100. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated.
Results— There were significant correlations for {DWI} versus {CT}-cerebral blood volume lesion volumes (r2=0.88, P{\textless}0.001), for {MR}-{MTT} versus {CT}-{MTT} lesion volumes(r2=0.86, P{\textless}0.001), and for {MR}-{MTT}/{DWI} versus {CT}-{MTT}/{CT}-cerebral blood volume mismatch lesion volumes(r2=0.81, P{\textless}0.001). {MR} perfusion and {CT} perfusion agreed for determining: (1) infarct core {\textless} versus ≥100 {mL} in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); (2) {MTT} lesion size {\textless} versus {\textgreater}2 cm diameter in 42 of 45 (93.3\%); (3) mismatch {\textless} versus {\textgreater}20\% in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); and (4) inclusion versus exclusion from trial enrollment in 38 of 45 (84.4\%) patients. Six of 7 disagreements were due to inadequate {CT} coverage.
Conclusion— Advanced {MR} and {CT} perfusion imaging measurements of core/penumbra mismatch for patient selection in stroke trials are highly correlated when {CT} perfusion coverage is sufficient to include most of the ischemic region. Although {MR} is currently the preferred imaging method for determining core and penumbra, {CT} perfusion is comparable and potentially more available.},

	abstract = {Depth intracranial electrodes ({IEs}) placement is one of the most used procedures to identify the epileptogenic zone ({EZ}) in surgical treatment of drug resistant epilepsy patients, about 20–30\% of this population. {IEs} localization is therefore a critical issue defining the {EZ} and its relation with eloquent functional areas. That information is then used to target the resective surgery and has great potential to affect outcome. We designed a methodological procedure intended to avoid the need for highly specialized medical resources and reduce time to identify the anatomical location of {IEs}, during the first instances of intracranial {EEG} recordings. This workflow is based on established open source software; 3D Slicer and Freesurfer that uses {MRI} and Post-implant {CT} fusion for the localization of {IEs} and its relation with automatic labeled surrounding cortex. To test this hypothesis we assessed the time elapsed between the surgical implantation process and the final anatomical localization of {IEs} by means of our proposed method compared against traditional visual analysis of raw post-implant imaging in two groups of patients. All {IEs} were identified in the first 24 H (6–24 H) of implantation using our method in 4 patients of the first group. For the control group; all {IEs} were identified by experts with an overall time range of 36 h to 3 days using traditional visual analysis. It included (7 patients), 3 patients implanted with {IEs} and the same 4 patients from the first group. Time to localization was restrained in this group by the specialized personnel and the image quality available. To validate our method; we trained two inexperienced operators to assess the position of {IEs} contacts on four patients (5 {IEs}) using the proposed method. We quantified the discrepancies between operators and we also assessed the efficiency of our method to define the {EZ} comparing the findings against the results of traditional analysis.},

	doi = {10.1109/42.736031},
	abstract = {Most previously reported registration techniques that align three-dimensional image volumes by matching geometrical features such as points or surfaces use a single type of feature. The authors recently reported a hybrid registration technique that uses a weighted combination of multiple geometrical feature shapes. In this study they use the weighted geometrical feature ({WGF}) algorithm to register computed tomography ({CT}) images of the head to physical space using the skin surface only, the bone surface only, and various weighted combinations of these surfaces and one fiducial point (centroid of a bone-implanted marker). The authors use data acquired from 12 patients that underwent temporal lobe craniotomies for the resection of cerebral lesions. The authors evaluate and compare the accuracy of the registrations obtained using these various approaches by using as a reference gold standard the registration obtained using three bone-implanted markers. The results demonstrate that a combination of geometrical features can improve the accuracy of {CT}-to-physical space registration. Point-based registration requires a minimum of three noncollinear points. The position of a bone-implanted marker can be determined much more accurately than that of a skin-affixed marker or an anatomic landmark. A major disadvantage of using bone-implanted markers is that an invasive procedure is required to implant each marker. By combining surface information, the {WGF} algorithm allows registration to be performed using only one or two such markers. One important finding is that the use of a single, very accurate point (a bone-implanted marker) allows very accurate surface-based registration to be achieved using very few surface points. Finally, the {WGF} algorithm, which not only allows the combination of multiple types of geometrical information but also handles point-based and surface-based registration as degenerate cases, could form the foundation of a "flexible" surgical navigation syste- - m that allows the surgeon to use what he considers the method most appropriate for an individual clinical situation.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— Although data on some risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) already are beyond doubt, for other factors, the evidence is less clear. We performed a systematic overview of case-control and cohort studies on risk factors for {ICH}.
Methods— We searched {MEDLINE}, {LILACS}, {EXTRAMED}, and Pascal from 1966 to 2001 to identify studies. Studies were included if they met predefined methodological criteria. When possible, 2×2 tables were extracted and combined with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Summary odds ratios ({ORs}) were calculated for case-control studies, and summary relative risks ({RRs}) were found for cohort studies and for case-control and cohort studies combined.
Results— Fourteen case-control and 11 cohort studies were identified. We could not always combine the results of case-control and cohort studies. In cohort studies, the crude {RR} for age (every 10-year increase) was 1.97 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.79 to 2.16). In case-control studies, the crude {OR} for high alcohol intake was 3.36 (95\% {CI}, 2.21 to 5.12) and for hypertension was 3.68 (95\% {CI}, 2.52 to 5.38). Two cohort studies showed an increasing risk of {ICH} with increasing degree of hypertension. In cohort and case-control studies combined, the crude {RR} for sex (male versus female) was 3.73 (95\% {CI}, 3.28 to 4.25); for current smoking, 1.31 (95\% {CI}, 1.09 to 1.58); and for diabetes, 1.30 (95\% {CI}, 1.02 to 1.67).
Conclusions— Risk factors for {ICH} appeared to be age, male sex, hypertension, and high alcohol intake. High cholesterol tends to be associated with a lower risk of {ICH}. We could not assess whether these risk factors are independent.},

Design Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify independent risk factors and to construct a grading scale for predicting the outcome of {ICH}.
Setting The Taichung Veterans General Hospital in Taichung, Taiwan.
Participants Two hundred and ninety-three patients were diagnosed with spontaneous {ICH} between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2007.
Intervention Development of the simplified {ICH} score ({sICH} score) for predicting the 30-day mortality of {ICH}.
Main Outcome Measures The discrimination of the prediction model was determined by measuring the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ({AUC}).
Results The accuracy of the {sICH} score was 80.5\%, the sensitivity was 82.5\% and the specificity was 80.2\%. The {AUCs} are as follows: {sICH} score, 0.89 (0.84–0.94); {ICH} score, 0.74 (0.65–0.83) and {ICH}-{GS}, 0.74 (0.65–0.83).
Conclusions The {sICH} score showed best discrimination among tested models. Also, it was easier for physicians without special training in neurology or radiology to use this scale. With statistical power and ease of use, the {sICH} score is a very suitable model for risk stratification of spontaneous {ICH}.},

Methods: Spontaneous eyes-closed and eyes-open {EEG} were recorded at 128 electrodes in 20 children aged 6–11 years and 23 adults aged 18–23 years. The surface Laplacian algorithm was applied to improve the spatial resolution of each electrode. Power and coherence were used to characterize the spatial structure of the alpha rhythm. A stochastic field model was used to eliminate coherences that are inflated due to volume conduction.
Results: In adults, the alpha rhythm is characterized by very high coherence between distant electrodes. The children demonstrated reduced anterior power and coherence between anterior and posterior electrodes at the peak alpha frequency in comparison to the adults. The Laplacian alpha rhythm demonstrated much higher power in the children at both anterior and posterior electrodes, but was weakly correlated between electrodes.
Conclusions: The maturation of neocortex in late childhood involves increased global correlation by long-range corticocortical connections. The local correlation that contributes power to each electrode, independent of other electrodes, is reduced as the global correlation increases.},

One solution is to display {MRI} scans in the same stereotaxic space popular with researchers working in functional neuroimaging. Presenting brains in this format is useful as the slices correspond to the standard anatomical atlases used by neuroimagers. In addition, lesion position and volume are directly comparable across patients. This article describes freely available software for presenting stereotaxically aligned patient scans. This article focuses on {MRI} scans, but many of these tools are also applicable to other modalities (e.g. {CT}, {PET} and {SPECT}).

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Trends in stroke incidence and mortality are available from few sites worldwide. The unique nature of the medical care in patients from Rochester, Minn, has allowed the ascertainment of virtually all cases of stroke for community residents for the period dating from 1955. This study updates incidence rates, stroke mortality, radiological imaging availability, and prevalence for stroke and subtypes of stroke though 1989 and evaluates trends since 1955., Methods: Medical records of all residents of Rochester with potential diagnosis of stroke during the 5-year period through December 31, 1989, were screened to determine whether the case met the criteria for stroke. The type of stroke was determined with the use of all available data. Average annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates for stroke and various types of stroke were calculated for 5-year periods from 1955 to 1989. Prevalence of stroke was also determined. Poisson regression was used to better clarify the dependence of stroke incidence on multiple variables. Cox proportional hazards modeling evaluated trends in short-term and long-term stroke survival., Results: We found that 496 incidence cases of stroke occurred among Rochester residents during 1985 to 1989. The annual age- and sex-adjusted stroke incidence rate was 145 per 100 000 population, which was virtually unchanged from 1980 to 1984 and 13\% higher than the rate determined in 1975 to 1979. Increasing incidence rates compared with the 1970s were noted in all groups aged older than 54 years and in both sexes. Survival after cerebral infarction was dependent on age and calendar year when trends dating from 1955 were evaluated. The annual incidence rate of intraparenchymal hemorrhage was twice that of subarachnoid hemorrhage., Conclusions: Incidence rates for stroke have remained at a higher rate than those determined in the 1970s. Although the occurrence of untreated hypertension has been reported to be stable or decreasing, the incidence rate of stroke is higher than those noted during the decline in stroke incidence during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the impact of radiological imaging, increased contribution of patients with ischemic heart disease, and the possible detection of milder cases of stroke, other factors, which are undefined, may be contributing to the increased stroke incidence rates detected over the last 10 years., (Stroke. 1996;27:373-380.), (C) 1996 American Heart Association, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI}.
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP}) scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr}) on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr}. The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes the findings of the {GBD} 2010 (Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors) study for hemorrhagic stroke ({HS}). Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2010. The {GBD} 2010 study provided standardized estimates of the incidence, mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratios ({MIR}), and disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) lost for {HS} (including intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) by age, sex, and income level (high-income countries [{HIC}]; low- and middle-income countries [{LMIC}]) for 21 {GBD} 2010 regions in 1990, 2005, and 2010. In 2010, there were 5.3 million cases of {HS} and over 3.0 million deaths due to {HS}. There was a 47\% increase worldwide in the absolute number of {HS} cases. The largest proportion of {HS} incident cases (80\%) and deaths (63\%) occurred in {LMIC} countries. There were 62.8 million {DALY} lost (86\% in {LMIC}) due to {HS}. The overall age-standardized incidence rate of {HS} per 100,000 person-years in 2010 was 48.41 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 45.44 to 52.13) in {HIC} and 99.43 (95\% {CI}: 85.37 to 116.28) in {LMIC}, and 81.52 (95\% {CI}: 72.27 to 92.82) globally. The age-standardized incidence of {HS} increased by 18.5\% worldwide between 1990 and 2010. In {HIC}, there was a reduction in incidence of {HS} by 8\% (95\% {CI}: 1\% to 15\%), mortality by 38\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 43\%), {DALY} by 39\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 44\%), and {MIR} by 27\% (95\% {CI}: 19\% to 35\%) in the last 2 decades. In {LMIC} countries, there was a significant increase in the incidence of {HS} by 22\% (95\% {CI}: 5\% to 30\%), whereas there was a significant reduction in mortality rates of 23\% (95\% {CI}: -3\% to 36\%), {DALY} lost of 25\% (95\% {CI}: 7\% to 38\%), and {MIR} by 36\% (95\% {CI}: 16\% to 49\%). There were significant regional differences in incidence rates of {HS}, with the highest rates in {LMIC} regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and lowest rates in High Income North America and Western Europe. The worldwide burden of {HS} has increased over the last 2 decades in terms of absolute numbers of {HS} incident events. The majority of the burden of {HS} is borne by {LMIC}. Rates for {HS} incidence, mortality, and {DALY} lost, as well as {MIR} decreased in the past 2 decades in {HIC}, but increased significantly in {LMIC} countries, particularly in those patients ≤75 years. {HS} affected people at a younger age in {LMIC} than in {HIC}. The lowest incidence and mortality rates in 2010 were in High Income North America, Australasia, and Western Europe, whereas the highest rates were in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. These results suggest that reducing the burden of {HS} is a priority particularly in {LMIC}. The {GBD} 2010 findings may be a useful resource for planning strategies to reduce the global burden of {HS}.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) constitutes 10\% to 15\% of all strokes and remains without a treatment of proven benefit. Despite several existing outcome prediction models for {ICH}, there is no standard clinical grading scale for {ICH} analogous to those for traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke.
Methods—Records of all patients with acute {ICH} presenting to the University of California, San Francisco during 1997–1998 were reviewed. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk stratification scale (the {ICH} Score) was developed with weighting of independent predictors based on strength of association.
Results—Factors independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale score (P{\textless}0.001), age ≥80 years (P=0.001), infratentorial origin of {ICH} (P=0.03), {ICH} volume (P=0.047), and presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (P=0.052). The {ICH} Score was the sum of individual points assigned as follows: {GCS} score 3 to 4 (=2 points), 5 to 12 (=1), 13 to 15 (=0); age ≥80 years yes (=1), no (=0); infratentorial origin yes (=1), no (=0); {ICH} volume ≥30 cm3 (=1), {\textless}30 cm3 (=0); and intraventricular hemorrhage yes (=1), no (=0). All 26 patients with an {ICH} Score of 0 survived, and all 6 patients with an {ICH} Score of 5 died. Thirty-day mortality increased steadily with {ICH} Score (P{\textless}0.005).
Conclusions—The {ICH} Score is a simple clinical grading scale that allows risk stratification on presentation with {ICH}. The use of a scale such as the {ICH} Score could improve standardization of clinical treatment protocols and clinical research studies in {ICH}.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— A simple clinical scale of intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}), comprising the Glasgow Coma Scale score, age, infratentorial origin, {ICH} volume, and intraventricular hemorrhage, was recently shown to predict 30-day mortality. We studied how well the original {ICH} Score would predict morbidity and mortality and determined whether modification would improve the predictions.
Methods— Patients admitted to a regional hospital with acute {ICH} in 1999 were reviewed. Independent predictors of mortality or good outcome (modified Rankin score ≤2) at 30 days were identified by logistic regression to devise a new {ICH} Score for comparison with the original Score. A modified Score was created by substituting National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) for the Glasgow Coma Scale.
Results— The mortality rate was 22\%, and 35\% had good outcome. Independent factors for mortality were high {NIHSS} score, intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid extension, and narrow pulse pressure. Independent factors for good outcome were low {NIHSS} score and low admission temperature. For all {ICH} Scores, no patient had a maximum score of 6. Cutoff values of ≥3 and {\textless}3 provided the best Youden’s index of diagnostic test in all {ICH} Scores for mortality and good outcome, respectively. The original and modified {ICH} Scores predict mortality equally well. The new and modified {ICH} Scores are slightly better for prediction of good outcome.
Conclusions— All 3 {ICH} Scores are simple clinical grading scales. As reliable predictors of good outcome and/or mortality, they are useful in clinical research studies and standardization of clinical protocols.},

	doi = {10.1109/42.730402},
	abstract = {In a previous study (J.B. West et al., J. Comput. Assist. Tomogr., vol. 21, p. 554-66, 1997) the authors demonstrated that automatic retrospective registration algorithms can frequently register magnetic resonance ({MR}) and computed tomography ({CT}) images of the brain with an accuracy of better than 2 mm, but in that same study the authors found that such algorithms sometimes fail, leading to errors of 6 mm or more. Before these algorithms can be used routinely in the clinic, methods must be provided for distinguishing between registration solutions that are clinically satisfactory and those that are not. One approach is to rely on a human observer to inspect the registration results and reject images that have been registered with insufficient accuracy. In this paper, the authors present a methodology for evaluating the efficacy of the visual assessment of registration accuracy. Since the clinical requirements for level of registration accuracy are likely to be application dependent, the authors have evaluated the accuracy of the observer's estimate relative to 6 thresholds: 1-6 mm. The performance of the observers was evaluated relative to the registration solution obtained using external fiducial markers that are screwed into the patient's skull and that are visible in both {MR} and {CT} images. This fiducial marker system provides the gold standard for the authors' study. Its accuracy is shown to be approximately 0.5 mm. Two experienced, blinded observers viewed 5 pairs of clinical {MR} and {CT} brain images, each of which had each been misregistered with respect to the gold standard solution. Fourteen misregistrations were assessed for each image pair with misregistration errors distributed between 0 and 10 mm with approximate uniformity. For each misregistered image pair each observer estimated the registration error (in millimeters) at each of 5 locations distributed around the head using each of 3 assessment methods. These estimated errors were compared with the e- - rrors as measured by the gold standard to determine agreement relative to each of the 6 thresholds, where agreement means that the 2 errors lie on the same side of the threshold. The effect of error in the gold standard itself is taken into account in the analysis of the assessment methods. The results were analyzed by means of the Kappa statistic, the agreement rate, and the area of receiver-operating-characteristic ({ROC}) curves. No assessment performed well at 1 mm, but all methods performed well at 2 mm and higher. For these 5 thresholds, 2 methods agreed with the standard at least 80\% of the time and exhibited mean {ROC} areas greater than 0.84. One of these same methods exhibited Kappa statistics that indicated good agreement relative to chance (Kappa{\textgreater}0.6) between the pooled observers and the standard for these same 5 thresholds. Further analysis demonstrates that the results depend strongly on the choice of the distribution of misregistration errors presented to the observers.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the 30-day mortality and morbidity of intracerebral hemorrhage in a large metropolitan population and to determine the most important predictors of 30-day outcome.
We reviewed the medical records and computed tomographic films for all cases of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in Greater Cincinnati during 1988. Independent predictors of 30-day mortality were determined using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses.
The 30-day mortality for the 188 cases of intracerebral hemorrhage was 44\%, with half of deaths occurring within the first 2 days of onset. Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage was the strongest predictor of 30-day mortality for all locations of intracerebral hemorrhage. Using three categories of parenchymal hemorrhage volume (0 to 29 cm3, 30 to 60 cm3, and 61 cm3 or more), calculated by a quick and easy-to-use ellipsoid method, and two categories of the Glasgow Coma Scale (9 or more and 8 or less), 30-day mortality was predicted correctly with a sensitivity of 96\% and a specificity of 98\%. Patients with a parenchymal hemorrhage volume of 60 cm3 or more on their initial computed tomogram and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less had a predicted 30-day mortality of 91\%. Patients with a volume of less than 30 cm3 and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9 or more had a predicted 30-day mortality of 19\%. Only one of the 71 patients with a volume of parenchymal hemorrhage of 30 cm3 or more could function independently at 30 days.
Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, in combination with the initial Glasgow Coma Scale score, is a powerful and easy-to-use predictor of 30-day mortality and morbidity in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose—Perihematomal edema ({PHE}) can worsen outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). Reports suggest that blood degradation products lead to {PHE}. We hypothesized that hematoma evacuation will reduce {PHE} volume and that treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-{PA}) will not exacerbate it.
Methods—Minimally invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation ({MISTIE}) phase {II} tested safety and efficacy of hematoma evacuation after {ICH}. We conducted a semiautomated, computerized volumetric analysis on computed tomography to assess impact of hematoma removal on {PHE} and effects of rt-{PA} on {PHE}. Volumetric analyses were performed on baseline stability and end of treatment scans.
Results—Seventy-nine surgical and 39 medical patients from minimally invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation phase {II} ({MISTIE} {II}) were analyzed. Mean hematoma volume at end of treatment was 19.6±14.5 cm3 for the surgical cohort and 40.7±13.9 cm3 for the medical cohort (P{\textless}0.001). Edema volume at end of treatment was lower for the surgical cohort: 27.7±13.3 cm3 than medical cohort: 41.7±14.6 cm3 (P{\textless}0.001). Graded effect of clot removal on {PHE} was observed when patients with {\textgreater}65\%, 20\% to 65\%, and {\textless}20\% {ICH} removed were analyzed (P{\textless}0.001). Positive correlation between {PHE} reduction and percent of {ICH} removed was identified (ρ=0.658; P{\textless}0.001). In the surgical cohort, 69 patients underwent surgical aspiration and rt-{PA}, whereas 10 underwent surgical aspiration only. Both cohorts achieved similar clot reduction: surgical aspiration and rt-{PA}, 18.9±14.5 cm3; and surgical aspiration only, 24.5±14.0 cm3 (P=0.26). Edema at end of treatment in surgical aspiration and rt-{PA} was 28.1±13.8 cm3 and 24.4±8.6 cm3 in surgical aspiration only (P=0.41).
Conclusions—Hematoma evacuation is associated with significant reduction in {PHE}. Furthermore, {PHE} does not seem to be exacerbated by rt-{PA}, making such neurotoxic effects unlikely when the drug is delivered to intracranial clot.},
